## How does it differ from the other mise-php plugins?

Although several PHP plugins are available for MISE, they often encounter errors on either Windows or various Linux distributions. The most common issue is locating the correct PHP versions. This is because PHP maintains its latest and older releases on different sites. Moreover, Windows and Linux installers are separated.

In the `verzly/php` repository, we collect these installers with daily updates and bundle all installers under a single release, associating them with the appropriate PHP version. The sole purpose of the `verzly/mise-php` plugin is to serve the necessary PHP version installers for both Windows and Linux systems based on the version numbers from `verzly/php`.
